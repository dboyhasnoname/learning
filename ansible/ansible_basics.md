## Why Ansible?

1. **Free:** Ansible is an open-source tool.
2. **Very simple to set up and use:** No special coding skills are necessary to use Ansible’s playbooks.
3. **Powerful:** Ansible lets you model even highly complex IT workflows. 
4. **Flexible:** We can orchestrate the entire application environment no matter where it’s deployed. 
5. **Agentless:** Leaves behind almost nothing. Uses SSH. We don’t need to install any other software or firewall ports on the client systems we want to automate. 
6. **Efficient:** Because we don’t need to install any extra software, there’s more room for application resources on your server.
7. **Secure:** Uses OS level security
8. **Idempotent:** No duplication of effort for configuration.
