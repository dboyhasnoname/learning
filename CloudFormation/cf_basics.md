# AWS CloudFormation

* Amazon AWS is a cloud-based platform that provides cloud services.
* AWS CloudFormation is designed to implement IaC. We can write scripts to build a custom infrastructure.
* AWS CloudFormation is a solution for dynamic infrastructures.
* AWS CloudFormation allows us to model your entire infrastructure in a text file. 

* AWS CloudFormation is available at no additional charge, and we pay only for the AWS resources needed to run our applications.

### benefits:

- **MODEL IT ALL:** AWS CloudFormation allows us to model your entire infrastructure in a text file. This template becomes the single source of truth for your infrastructure. This helps to standardize infrastructure components used across the organization, enabling configuration compliance and faster troubleshooting.

- **AUTOMATE AND DEPLOY:** AWS CloudFormation provision resources in a safe, repeatable manner, allowing us to build and rebuild our infrastructure and applications, without having to perform manual actions or write custom scripts. CloudFormation takes care of determining the right operations to perform when managing the stack, and rolls back changes automatically if errors are detected.

- **IT'S JUST CODE:** Codifying the infrastructure allow us to treat our infrastructure as just code. We can author it with any code editor, check it into a version control system, and review the files with team members before deploying into production.
